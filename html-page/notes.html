Make connections,that tells your net worth.
<br>Take notes during lecture to avoid falling asleep.
<br>Practice problems daily, or you'll regret later.
<br>Well Eng1002 is for the students who did well in EPT and Eng1001 is for students who need assistance.
<br>There are around 9 technical clubs for CSE in VIT-APTraversy, coder-coder are good aren't they ?
<br>Soon, Drone tech and it's software Dev might reek money.The purpose of life is....
<br>Idk, everyone has something for themselves.Ok serious business, the purpose of any work is fun, neither fame, nor wealth and definitely not duty.

<br>slope of tangent of curve =

<br>
<br>func can exist with critical points that aren't extrema
<br> 1st deriv test
<br> find f'
<br> find f' at critical points 
<br> eval f(x) critical points and endpoints 
<br> find the extrema

<br>Rolle's theorem
<br> f cont in [a,b]
<br> f'diff-able in (a,b)
<br> if f(a)=f(b)
<br> then at least one c in[a,b]
<br>  :f'(c)=0 horizontal exists

if f'(c)=0 not exist
 even if 
 f is cont
 f' is diff-able
  :f(x) has only 1 zero

Lagrange mean value theorem
 f cont in [a,b]
 f'diff-able in (a,b)
  then at least one c in[a,b]
   B=f(b)
   A=f(a)
   :f'(c)= [B-A]/[b-a] tangent parallel to AB
 f' instantaneous change
 (B-A)/(b-a) is avg change

for const func f=k
 f'=0

if f'=g'
 f=g+C
 then f-g =c is a cons func

f'>0 at each (a,b) 
 then f is incre
f'<0 at each (a,b) 
 then f is decre

f(x) concavity== f''(x)

if f is
 increasing : 
  concave up, f''>0; 
  local min at x
  might be f'>0
  
 decreasing : 
  concave down, f''<0;
  local max at x
  might be f'<0


c is :
 critical point if f'= 0 or won't exist
 inflection point if f''=0 or won't exist
     

even if
 f''=0 it doesn't mean there's point of inflection
  eg) y=x^4

while interval calc
